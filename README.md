# ppol565_spring2021_project
Alexander Adams Spring 2021 Final Project for PPOL565 Data Science II: Applied Statistical Learning

This repository contains all of the files and code for all steps of my final project, from the initial proposal to the final report.

Speaking of that final report, it's available here: https://github.com/aadams149/ppol565_spring2021_project/blob/main/PPOL565_White_Paper.pdf

Additional Clarification:
Scripts_and_Code/memo 2 viz.ipynb is the jupyter notebook I used to make visualizations for memo 2
''/project_script is the notebook I used to run the different models I used for this project
rf_cm.png is the Random Forest confusion matrix
dt_cm.png is the Decision Tree confusion matrix
Memos and presentation slides are in the Memos folder
Raw data files are in the Data and Documentation folder. The relative pathways for python scripts assume that the .csv is in the Data and Documentation folder, so move it at your own peril.
